# Welcome!

This is mostly an interal wiki for us to have documentation on how to mod Arma 3 (so we don't forget anything), everything from a few re-textures to importing models and extened configs. Everything will eventually have a place here, we're still learning ourselves and may not have the best practices or complete documentation so bear with.

# Why?

Despite being a old game with pretty big modding fanbase and teams, surprisingly, there is next to no recent or fully up to date documentation of a lot of Arma's modding adn have to rely purely on Arma 3's samples or finding someone willing to help you do the certain task you wish to do. We aim to create this so there is a more longer lasting documentation that people can find and go along without too much hassle. Yes, we also realise that a lot of things are possibly going redundant in the next few years with the next ArmA installment but we are a new full modding team to ArmA 3 simply going along our merry journey.
