# Intro

In retrospect of the legendary PMC Arma3 Ultimate Terrain Tutorial, I wished to recreate their legendary terrain guide, however in a more modern setting. By all means, this is NOT to replace the PMCs guide, merely just to add as much knowledge as possible to the Arma 3 Community in a centralised location. 

In this I wish to teach you the basics, then procede to give you ideas on how to develop your map further using the basics taught.

We're covering the following
3. Setup
11. L3DT + Terrain Generation
8. Heightmaps
12412. Attribute + Texture maps
21. Export and Import to Terrain Builder
38. Terrain Builder Setup
    381. Bulldozer
42. Object Placement
    421. Object Placement Singular
    422. Object Placement Shapes (Multiple)
53. Terrain Processor
69. Roads
